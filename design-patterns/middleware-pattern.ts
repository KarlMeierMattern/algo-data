// The middleware pattern makes it easy for us to simplify many-to-many relationships between objects, by letting all communication flow through one central point.
// Think of it as a mediator where components interact with each other through a central point
// Think of air traffic controller and pilots. The pilots don't talk to each other directly, they all go through the air traffic controller.

// A good use case for the mediator pattern is a chatroom.
// The users within the chatroom wonâ€™t talk to each other directly. Instead, the chatroom serves as the mediator between the users.

class ChatRoom {
  public logMessage(user: User, message: string): void {
    const sender = user.getName();
    console.log(`${new Date().toLocaleString()} [${sender}]: ${message}`);

class User {
